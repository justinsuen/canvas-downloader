# Loading State for Course Fetching - Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-09-25
**Task**: Add loading spinner and backend logging when fetching courses from Canvas API

## Overview
Currently when users enter their Canvas API configuration and the system fetches courses, there's no visual loading indicator in the frontend and minimal logging in the backend. This creates poor UX as users don't know if the system is working.

## Current State Analysis
- Frontend already sets `downloadStatus` to 'loading' in `CanvasDownloader.jsx:172`
- Frontend has log message "Fetching courses from Canvas..." in `CanvasDownloader.jsx:173`
- Backend `/api/courses` endpoint exists but lacks detailed logging
- No visual loading spinner in the UI during course fetching

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Frontend Loading State ✅ (In Progress)
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/CourseSelector.jsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Import `Loader` icon from lucide-react
  - Add loading state UI when `downloadStatus === 'loading'`
  - Display animated spinner with "Fetching courses from Canvas..." message
  - Show this before the "No courses found" state

### 2. Backend Logging Enhancement
- **File**: `server/app.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Add logging at start of `/api/courses` endpoint
  - Add logging for Canvas API initialization
  - Add logging for user retrieval
  - Add logging for course count retrieved
  - Add error logging with more detail

### 3. Testing
- Test with valid Canvas credentials
- Test with invalid credentials
- Verify loading state appears immediately
- Verify logs appear in backend console

## Success Criteria
- [x] Loading spinner appears when "Save Configuration" is clicked
- [x] Backend logs show "Fetching courses from Canvas..." or similar
- [x] Backend logs show successful course retrieval with count
- [x] Loading state disappears when courses load or error occurs
- [x] Error states still work properly

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/CourseSelector.jsx` - Added loading UI with spinner ✅
- `server/app.py` - Added enhanced logging for course fetching process ✅

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes (`CourseSelector.jsx`)
- Added `Loader` import from lucide-react
- Added loading state UI that displays when `downloadStatus === 'loading'`
- Shows animated spinner with descriptive message "Fetching courses from Canvas..."
- Loading state appears before empty courses state

### Backend Changes (`server/app.py`)
- Added detailed logging at each step of the `/api/courses` endpoint:
  - Request received logging
  - Canvas API connection initialization
  - User authentication confirmation
  - Course retrieval with count
- Uses Python `logger.info()` and `logger.error()` for console output

### Socket.IO Integration Enhancement (`server/app.py`)
- Added `emit_log_to_client()` helper function for Socket.IO log emission
- Refactored `DownloadManager.emit_log()` to use the helper function
- Modified frontend to send `socketId` in course fetch request
- Updated `/api/courses` endpoint to emit real-time logs to frontend during:
  - Request received
  - Canvas API initialization
  - User authentication
  - Course retrieval progress
  - Success/error states

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED + ENHANCED

## What Now Happens
1. User enters Canvas credentials and clicks "Save Configuration"
2. Frontend shows animated loading spinner immediately
3. Backend logs appear in real-time in the frontend log panel:
   - "Received request to fetch courses from Canvas API"
   - "Initializing Canvas API connection to [url]"
   - "Fetching current user information from Canvas"
   - "Successfully authenticated as user: [name]"
   - "Fetching user's courses from Canvas API..."
   - "Retrieved X active courses from Canvas"
   - "Successfully processed X courses"
4. Loading spinner disappears and courses populate
5. All logs also appear in backend console for debugging
